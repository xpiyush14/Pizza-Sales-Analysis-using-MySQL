# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-MySQL
This project is a data analysis of pizza sales using MySQL, where I explored sales data sourced from Kaggle. The objective was to gain insights into customer preferences, revenue trends, and ordering patterns by writing SQL queries to answer business-driven questions.

# Objectives
1.) The main goals of this analysis were to:
2.) Understand order volume and revenue trends
3.) Identify the most popular pizzas and sizes
4.) Explore category-wise ordering patterns
5.) Analyze time-based ordering behavior
6.) Determine the top revenue-generating pizzas

# Steps Taken
1.) Data Collection
Dataset obtained from Kaggle Pizza Sales Dataset.
Imported data into MySQL for querying and analysis.

2.) Basic Analysis
Retrieved total number of orders placed.
Calculated total revenue generated.
Identified the highest-priced pizza.
Found the most common pizza size ordered.
Listed top 5 most ordered pizzas by quantity.

3.) Intermediate Analysis
Joined tables to find total quantity ordered per category.
Analyzed order distribution by hour of the day.
Explored category-wise pizza distribution.

4.) Advanced Analysis
Calculated each pizza typeâ€™s percentage contribution to revenue.
Analyzed cumulative revenue trends over time.
Found the top 3 revenue-generating pizzas for each category.

# Tools & Technologies
1.) SQL (MySQL) for querying and analysis
2.) Kaggle dataset for real-world sales data

# Outcomes
Through this analysis, I uncovered valuable insights such as the most profitable pizzas, ordering time patterns, and revenue contribution by category, which can help businesses in inventory planning, menu optimization, and sales strategies.

Grouped orders by date to calculate average pizzas sold per day.

Determined top 3 pizzas based on revenue.
